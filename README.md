    <b>âœ¨ Procedural Fish Cursor Trail ðŸš€ - Work in Progress</b>
</p>

## Overview

This project creates a procedural cursor trail using HTML5 Canvas and JavaScript. The cursor trail is composed of a series of dots connected in a chain, which follow the cursor's movement and create a smooth, flowing effect.

## Features

- Procedural generation of cursor trail
- Smooth transitions and animations
- Customizable appearance and behavior
- Responsive to window resizing

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/procedural-cursor.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd procedural-cursor
   ```
3. Open `index.html` in your preferred web browser.

## Usage

Move your cursor around the screen to see the procedural trail in action. The trail will follow your cursor and adapt to its movement.

## Customization

You can customize the appearance and behavior of the cursor trail by modifying the `main.js` file. Some of the configurable options include:

- `CONSTRAINT`: The distance between each dot in the chain.
- `SHOW_CONSTRAINT`: Toggle the visibility of the constraint circles.
- `SHOW_DOT`: Toggle the visibility of the dots.
- `SHOW_SEGMENT`: Toggle the visibility of the segments.
